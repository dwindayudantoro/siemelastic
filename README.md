# Welcome to Elastic-Agent 8.6.2

Agent manages other beats based on configuration provided.

## Getting Started

To get started with Elastic-Agent, you need to set up Elasticsearch on
your localhost first. After that, start Elastic-Agent with:

     ./elastic-agent -c elastic-agent.yml -e

This will start Elastic-Agent and send the data to your Elasticsearch
instance. To load the dashboards for Elastic-Agent into Kibana, run:

    ./elastic-agent setup -e
